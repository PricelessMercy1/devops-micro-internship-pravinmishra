# Assignment 2 — Deploy A Static Website to AWS EC2 Using an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will import and personalize the Static Website, provision and configure an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and Ansible, and create an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the website to Nginx through an SSH Service Connection.

---

# Task 0 — Verify the Existing Tooling and Self-Hosted Agent

## Goal

Confirm that Terraform, Ansible, AWS CLI, SSH, and the self-hosted Azure Pipelines agent are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Import and Personalize the Azure Static Website Repository

## Goal

Import the Azure Static Website into Azure Repos and add your Full Name to the website.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Azure Static Website in Azure Repos

Add a screenshot of Azure Repos showing:

* Imported Azure Static Website repository
* Project files
* `index.html`

# Task 2 — Provision and Configure the Target EC2 Instance

## Goal

Provision the AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and configure Nginx, SSH access, and deployment permissions using Ansible.

No additional submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Create the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection that can connect to the target EC2 instance using your selected SSH authentication method.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 2 — SSH Service Connection

Add a screenshot of the saved SSH Service Connection **Overview** page showing:

* Service Connection name
* SSH connection type

# Task 4 — Create the Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline that deploys the Azure Static Website to the target EC2 instance after a commit is pushed.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Azure Pipelines YAML

Add a screenshot of `azure-pipelines.yml` open in the Azure Repos editor showing:

* Push trigger
* Selected self-hosted agent pool
* Pipeline variables
* Repository checkout step
* Pipeline information step
* `CopyFilesOverSSH@0` task
* `SSH@0` verification task

> Ensure that no password, SSH private key, PAT, or AWS credential is visible.

---

# Task 5 — Create, Authorize, and Run the Pipeline

## Goal

Run the Azure DevOps pipeline and confirm that the website files are transferred and verified successfully.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Successful Pipeline Run

Add a screenshot of the successful pipeline run and log summary showing:

* Overall pipeline status as **Succeeded**
* Pipeline information step completed
* File-copy step completed
* Remote-verification step completed
* Your Full Name visible in the pipeline output

# Task 6 — Verify the Website and Automatic Trigger

## Goal

Confirm that the website is accessible through the EC2 public IP address and that a new pushed commit automatically triggers another deployment.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Deployed Azure Static Website

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Deployed Azure Static Website
* EC2 public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Updated website content after the automatic deployment

## Final Website URL

`http://<target-vm-public-ip>`

Replace the placeholder with your actual website URL:

http://18.222.249.89

# Assignment Summary

Write a short summary of the completed CI/CD workflow.

Assignment Summary

I imported the Azure Static Website repository into Azure Repos and added my full name to index.html. I provisioned an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS us-east-2 with Terraform (a free-tier t3.micro, a dynamically looked-up AMI, and a security group allowing SSH only from my IP and the self-hosted agent, plus HTTP). Ansible then installed and enabled Nginx and made /var/www/html writable by the SSH deployment user, using private-key authentication only.

In Azure DevOps, I created an SSH service connection and a YAML pipeline that triggers on every pushed branch and runs on my self-hosted agent pool. The pipeline does a clean checkout, prints my name, branch, commit and agent, copies the site to /var/www/html with CopyFilesOverSSH@0, and verifies the deployment with SSH@0 by listing the files, confirming index.html exists, and requiring a successful local HTTP response.

I tested the automation by committing a change to index.html. This started a new pipeline run automatically, which succeeded, and the updated content appeared at the EC2 public IP.
