# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

The cost optimizer uses Haiku because its main job is to quickly identify cost-saving opportunities in the Terraform infrastructure. This task does not require deep reasoning like a security audit, so Haiku provides faster responses while using fewer resources.

---

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

The security auditor does not have the Write tool because it is designed to inspect and report security issues without modifying any files. Limiting it to read-only tools helps prevent accidental changes and ensures the audit remains safe and reliable.

---

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

The tf-writer uses inherit so it automatically uses the same model as the main Claude session instead of being tied to a specific model. This gives it the flexibility to use whichever model is currently active while generating or editing Terraform code.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — The delegation message showing Claude launched the security-auditor

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — The full cost optimization report
